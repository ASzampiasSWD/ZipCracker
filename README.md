Crack Zip Files on Windows. 

I noticed all the Zip Crackers on Windows OS cost money. I made my own for $0. 

Use fcrackzip program on Linux. Here is an example command:
fcrackzip -D -p rockyou.txt -u -v secret.zip


Button will turn green if a password is found and a new window will appear.
Button will turn red if no password is found and a new window will appear. 

 Note: No error handling for invalid files.
