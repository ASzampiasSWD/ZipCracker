Version 1.

Crack Zip Files on Windows. 

I noticed all the Zip Crackers on Windows OS cost money. I made my own for $0. 

Use fcrackzip program on Linux. Here is an example command:
fcrackzip -D -p rockyou.txt -u -v secret.zip

Button will turn green if a password is found and a new window will appear.
Button will turn red if no password is found and a new window will appear. 

 Notes: 
 No error handling for invalid files.
 Have not checked if this works on Linux.
 Compiled with recent version of JDK. Need to research on how to allow cross compatibility.
